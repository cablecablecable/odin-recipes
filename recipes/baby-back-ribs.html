<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    These slow cooker ribs are the best — they turn out perfect every time! They cook in a crockpot until tender,
    then are covered with barbeque sauce and finished in the oven for fall-apart ribs.
    Perfect for during the week as the slow cooker does most of the work!
